# PIE
PGM Image Editor

TL;DR; One Class, One File Format, One Project


What is PIE
-----------
Pie is a small command line application to manipulate GrayMap (PGM) files, hence the name PIE (PGM Image Editor)
This started as a school project with a two-week deadline but grew pretty quickly.

PIE's Interface is written in German, I will change this as soon as it is submitted to my School.
