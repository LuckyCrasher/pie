# PIE
PGM Image Editor

TL;DR; One Class, One File Format, One Project

What is PIE
-----------
Pie is a small command line application to manipulate GrayMap (PGM) files, hence the name PIE (PGM Image Editor)
This started as a school project with a two-week deadline but grew pretty quickly.

PIE's Interface is written in German, I will change this as soon as it is submitted to my school.

PIE is capable of:
 - Blurring with normal Box Blurs, or a highly configurable Gaussian Blur.
 - Doing some Basic Edge detection  
 - Loading images to different layers and combining them
 - Inverting an Image
 - Lightning or Darkening an Image
 - Loading Images of different Sizes then the original anticipated 400 by 300 pixels
 - Show Images while editing.
 - Performing these operations on a snippet of the Image
